Combing your little habits
A small habit is a minimalist habit tracking app. There is no social, no group, just focus on each day. Have big dreams, want to be a very powerful person, and start from every little day. Give your own habits a day, and stick to it every day to make a dream come true.

Small habits can be used not only as a habit tracking tool, but also as a small diary of the day, recording what common things you have done each day, and punching out your daily completions.

â€¢ Today's habit
1. It is possible to set which days of the week are repeated for each habit, and which time period is executed;
2. The habits to be adhered to today will be presented separately on the TODAY page. A little picture will indicate the completion of the customary punch.
3. Push a card every day, and when all the habits are completed today, you can get the card and collect it. You can motivate yourself by recording the feelings of the day on the back of the card
