## [Product Characteristics]

All Scriptures written by the silence of God are useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for teaching people to learn justice, so that God's people may be perfect and suitable for all kinds of good works. (Diary 2 3:16-17)
Reading the Bible and prayer are an important way for our Christians to talk to God. Reading the Bible means that we listen to God's Word and meditate on God's teaching to us. God's Word is our spiritual lamp before we walk. It is the light on our path. Through reading the Bible to understand God's will in us, we rely on God to walk the path of our lives.
Although the rhythm of modern people's life is fast, in our busy life, we cannot escape from God's path and leave God's path. Thanks to the wisdom and grace that God has given us, we developed the software as the Bible reading, spiritual, and evangelical tools of the New Age using the most commonly used “Spirit Bible” of the Catholic Church (Roman Catholic Church) and became our Christian’s good helper. It mainly contains the following functions:
1. The Voice Bible can still listen to God's Word when it is inconvenient to read.
2, read the golden sentence, often read, keep in mind God's teaching to us.
3, bookmarks
4, full-text search, a good helper for the Bible, according to find the scriptures where the text.
5, social sharing, through the sharing function of iOS, the Bible can be shared to friends by SMS, Weibo, etc., and become a new channel for evangelization.
There are many intimate small functions such as male/female voice switching, text size setting, last reading recording, and key word highlighting.

I hope this software can help you to better understand God and follow Christ. At the same time, we will continue to introduce more Catholic spiritual software and we look forward to your attention and support.
May glory be attributed to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. How was it at first, today, and forever? Amen.
